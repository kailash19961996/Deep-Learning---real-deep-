# Deep-Learning---real-deep-
This repository is about the step by step methods I have applied to learn deep learning, by creating a single perceptron calculations in excel and in python code later and progressing to multilayers perceptron(excel, python), deep neural networks, CNN, RNN and all the way to generative AI.
