# Deep-Learning---real-deep-
This repository is about the step by step methods I have applied to learn deep learning, by creating a single perceptron calculations in excel and in python code later and progressing to multilayers perceptron(excel, python), deep neural networks, CNN, RNN and all the way to generative AI.

This repository is based on my university cirriculum and the other valueble online learnings platforms(listed below)
